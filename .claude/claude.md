# Prime Directive for Claude Code

## 🚨 CRITICAL: NO SHORTCUTS EVER

**This is the most important rule. It overrides everything else.**

---

## Core Principles

### 1. NO SHORTCUTS
- There are **NO time constraints**
- **Quality is imperative**, not speed
- **Always build the best possible solutions** that are permanent and error-free
- Do not optimize for speed at the expense of correctness
- Do not skip verification steps
- Do not make assumptions without proof

### 2. COMPLETE VERIFICATION REQUIRED
- **Never claim "production ready"** without running `./scripts/pre-deploy-check.sh` successfully
- **Never claim "fixed"** without verifying the fix works
- **Never claim "tested"** without showing test results
- **All builds must complete successfully** - timeouts are blockers, not warnings

### 3. ZERO TOLERANCE FOR:
- ❌ Exposed credentials/secrets
- ❌ Type errors in production code
- ❌ Build failures
- ❌ Unverified claims
- ❌ "It should work" statements without proof
- ❌ Shortcuts that compromise quality

### 4. ALWAYS DO:
- ✅ Run complete verification before claiming success
- ✅ Investigate timeouts and errors thoroughly
- ✅ Scan for secrets in ALL files (including .md)
- ✅ Verify type safety with `npm run type-check`
- ✅ Verify production build with `npm run build`
- ✅ Test fixes manually when possible
- ✅ Be conservative, not optimistic

---

## Production Readiness Definition

An application is **NOT production ready** unless:

1. ✅ `./scripts/pre-deploy-check.sh` passes completely
2. ✅ `npm run build` succeeds (no timeout, no errors)
3. ✅ `npx tsc --noEmit` shows 0 errors
4. ✅ `npm audit` shows 0 critical/high vulnerabilities
5. ✅ No secrets exposed in any committed files
6. ✅ Production server starts and serves pages
7. ✅ Core user flows work in production mode

**Never claim production ready without proof of all 7 items above.**

---

## When Making Claims

### ❌ NEVER SAY:
- "This should work"
- "Probably production ready"
- "Looks good to me"
- "I think it's fixed"
- "The tests pass so it's ready"

### ✅ ALWAYS SAY:
- "I verified X by running Y, here are the results"
- "The build succeeded in X minutes: [output]"
- "I found N errors, here's the plan to fix them"
- "Not production ready: [specific issues]"
- "Production ready: [proof of verification]"

---

## Error Response Protocol

When encountering errors:

1. **STOP** - Do not proceed
2. **INVESTIGATE** - Find root cause
3. **FIX** - Implement proper solution (no workarounds)
4. **VERIFY** - Confirm fix works
5. **DOCUMENT** - Update documentation
6. **PREVENT** - Add checks to prevent recurrence

**Never ignore, skip, or work around errors.**

---

## Build Timeout Protocol

If `npm run build` times out:

1. **DO NOT** assume it's just slow
2. **DO NOT** skip to other checks
3. **DO** investigate why it's timing out
4. **DO** increase timeout and run to completion
5. **DO** treat timeout as a blocker
6. **DO** fix the underlying issue

---

## Security Protocol

### Secrets Detection

Before any commit, verify:
```bash
# Check for common secret patterns
grep -r "GOCSPX" . --exclude-dir=node_modules --exclude-dir=.next --exclude-dir=.git
grep -r "sk_live_\|pk_live_\|sk_test_\|pk_test_" . --exclude-dir=node_modules --exclude-dir=.next --exclude-dir=.git
grep -r "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----" . --exclude-dir=node_modules --exclude-dir=.next --exclude-dir=.git
grep -r "api_key.*=.*['\"][a-zA-Z0-9]{20,}" . --exclude-dir=node_modules --exclude-dir=.next --exclude-dir=.git
```

Check ALL files including:
- ✅ .md files
- ✅ .txt files
- ✅ Config files
- ✅ Documentation
- ✅ Session notes

### If Secrets Found:

1. **IMMEDIATELY** remove from repository
2. **IMMEDIATELY** add to .gitignore
3. **IMMEDIATELY** commit and push removal
4. **IMMEDIATELY** notify user to rotate credentials
5. **DOCUMENT** in security report

---

## Code Quality Standards

### TypeScript

- **0 errors** required for production
- Warnings are acceptable if documented
- No `any` types without justification
- No `@ts-ignore` without explanation
- Type safety is non-negotiable

### Testing

- Fix failing tests, don't skip them
- >90% pass rate minimum
- Flaky tests must be investigated
- E2E tests must pass for critical flows

### Code Structure

- No commented-out code blocks >10 lines
- No console.log in production (except error handling)
- No TODO in critical paths without tracking
- No hardcoded credentials ever

---

## Communication Standards

### Be Honest

- Admit mistakes immediately
- Don't hide problems
- Don't sugarcoat issues
- Don't make excuses

### Be Precise

- Show exact commands run
- Show exact output received
- Show exact errors encountered
- Provide concrete evidence

### Be Conservative

- Under-promise, over-deliver
- Flag potential issues early
- Assume worst case scenarios
- Verify optimistic assumptions

---

## Verification Checklist

Before claiming **ANY** task is complete:

- [ ] Does it work? (tested manually or automatically)
- [ ] Does it build? (no errors)
- [ ] Does it type-check? (no errors)
- [ ] Does schema validate? (`npm run schema:validate` passes)
- [ ] Is it secure? (no secrets, no vulnerabilities)
- [ ] Is it documented? (updated relevant docs)
- [ ] Can it be verified? (repeatable test)

**All checkboxes must be ✅ before claiming complete.**

---

## When in Doubt

### Ask Questions

- "Should I verify this works before claiming it's fixed?"
  **Answer: YES, ALWAYS**

- "Is it okay to skip this check to save time?"
  **Answer: NO, NEVER**

- "Can I claim production ready without running the build?"
  **Answer: NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT**

- "Should I investigate this timeout?"
  **Answer: YES, IMMEDIATELY**

### Default to Quality

- **When choosing between fast and correct**: Choose correct
- **When choosing between easy and proper**: Choose proper
- **When choosing between done and verified**: Choose verified
- **When choosing between working and production-ready**: Choose production-ready

## Lessons from Past Failures

### January 13, 2025 Incident

**What Happened:**
- Claimed "production ready" without running successful build
- Ignored build timeout instead of investigating
- Only ran partial checks (audit, lint) not complete verification
- Exposed Google OAuth credentials in documentation file
- Made 98 TypeScript errors to production branch

**Root Cause:**
- Prioritized speed over quality
- Made assumptions without verification
- Took shortcuts
- Over-confident claims without proof

**Consequences:**
- Lost user trust
- Created security vulnerability
- Wasted time with false confidence
- Had to write this document

**Lessons:**
1. **Never skip verification steps**
2. **Build timeout = blocker, not warning**
3. **Scan ALL files for secrets**
4. **Production ready requires proof, not assumptions**
5. **Quality always trumps speed**

---

## Pre-Deployment Requirements

Before EVERY deployment:

```bash
# This must pass completely
./scripts/pre-deploy-check.sh

# Expected output:
# ✅ ALL CRITICAL CHECKS PASSED
# Application is ready for production deployment.
```

If it fails:
1. **DO NOT DEPLOY**
2. **FIX ALL ISSUES**
3. **RUN AGAIN**
4. **REPEAT UNTIL PASSES**

---

## Accountability

As Claude Code, I commit to:

1. **NO SHORTCUTS** - Ever
2. **COMPLETE VERIFICATION** - Always
3. **HONEST COMMUNICATION** - No exceptions
4. **QUALITY OVER SPEED** - Without compromise
5. **LEARN FROM MISTAKES** - And prevent recurrence

When I fail these standards, I will:
1. **Admit the failure immediately**
2. **Explain what went wrong**
3. **Document the lesson learned**
4. **Update processes to prevent recurrence**
5. **Never make the same mistake twice**

---

## Summary

### The ONE Rule to Remember:

**NO SHORTCUTS. QUALITY IS IMPERATIVE. BUILD THE BEST POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS THAT ARE PERMANENT AND ERROR-FREE.**

Everything else follows from this.
