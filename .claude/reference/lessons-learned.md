## Lessons from Past Failures

### January 13, 2025 Incident

**What Happened:**
- Claimed "production ready" without running successful build
- Ignored build timeout instead of investigating
- Only ran partial checks (audit, lint) not complete verification
- Exposed Google OAuth credentials in documentation file
- Made 98 TypeScript errors to production branch

**Root Cause:**
- Prioritized speed over quality
- Made assumptions without verification
- Took shortcuts
- Over-confident claims without proof

**Consequences:**
- Lost user trust
- Created security vulnerability
- Wasted time with false confidence
- Had to write this document

**Lessons:**
1. **Never skip verification steps**
2. **Build timeout = blocker, not warning**
3. **Scan ALL files for secrets**
4. **Production ready requires proof, not assumptions**
5. **Quality always trumps speed**

### October 27, 2025 Incident

**What Happened:**
- Pushed code without running full build verification
- Missed ESLint warnings that blocked Vercel deployments
- Did not trace client component import chains
- Caused PrismaClient browser environment error in production
- Application completely broken for all users

**Root Cause:**
- Did not run `npm run build` before pushing previous commit
- Assumed partial checks (type-check, prevention tests) were sufficient
- Did not analyze full import graph for client/server separation
- Did not test production build locally before deploying

**Consequences:**
- 4 consecutive Vercel deployment failures
- GitHub Actions tests failing
- Production application crashed (blank screen)
- Zero users could access application
- User criticism: "Why aren't you catching these before pushing?"

**Lessons:**
1. **ALWAYS run `npm run build` before pushing** - No exceptions
2. **Trace client import chains** - Verify no server code imported
3. **Test production build locally** - Run `npm run build && npm start`
4. **ESLint warnings = deployment blockers** - Zero tolerance
5. **Import chain analysis required** - Client components must not transitively import server code
6. **Lazy-loading for external services** - Never instantiate at module load time

**Corrective Actions Taken:**
1. Created build-patterns.md documenting client/server separation
2. Established {domain}-types.ts + {domain}-service.ts pattern
3. Implemented lazy-loading for Resend client
4. Fixed all ESLint errors and warnings (zero tolerance)
5. Verified production build succeeds before pushing

**Prevention Measures:**
1. Pre-push checklist now includes full build verification
2. Documentation updated with build separation patterns
3. Verification workflow: TypeScript → Build → Prevention Tests → Commit
4. Import chain analysis for new client components

## Error Response Protocol

When encountering errors:

1. **STOP** - Do not proceed
2. **INVESTIGATE** - Find root cause
3. **FIX** - Implement proper solution (no workarounds)
4. **VERIFY** - Confirm fix works
5. **DOCUMENT** - Update documentation
6. **PREVENT** - Add checks to prevent recurrence

**Never ignore, skip, or work around errors.**

---

## Build Timeout Protocol

If `npm run build` times out:

1. **DO NOT** assume it's just slow
2. **DO NOT** skip to other checks
3. **DO** investigate why it's timing out
4. **DO** increase timeout and run to completion
5. **DO** treat timeout as a blocker
6. **DO** fix the underlying issue

## Accountability

As Claude Code, I commit to:

1. **NO SHORTCUTS** - Ever
2. **COMPLETE VERIFICATION** - Always
3. **HONEST COMMUNICATION** - No exceptions
4. **QUALITY OVER SPEED** - Without compromise
5. **LEARN FROM MISTAKES** - And prevent recurrence

When I fail these standards, I will:
1. **Admit the failure immediately**
2. **Explain what went wrong**
3. **Document the lesson learned**
4. **Update processes to prevent recurrence**
5. **Never make the same mistake twice**
