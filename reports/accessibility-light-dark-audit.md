## ðŸŽ¯ Recommended Fixes

### Critical Issues to Address:

1. **Color Contrast** - Most common violation in both modes
   - Light mode: Check foreground/background color combinations
   - Dark mode: Verify dark background colors meet contrast ratios

2. **Icon Buttons** - Missing aria-labels
   - Add descriptive aria-label to all icon-only buttons
   - Example: `<button aria-label="Open menu"><IconComponent /></button>`

3. **Mode-Specific Issues**:
   - Light mode: Links and secondary text colors
   - Dark mode: Ensure all colors are properly inverted and still accessible

### Next Steps:
1. Fix all CRITICAL violations first
2. Then address SERIOUS violations
3. Verify fixes in both light and dark modes
4. Re-run audit to confirm 0 violations
