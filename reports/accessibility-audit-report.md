## Recommended Fixes

### Priority 1: Color Contrast Issues (CRITICAL)

**Found 35 color contrast violations**

**Fix**: Update CSS to meet WCAG AA contrast ratios:

```css
/* BEFORE: Insufficient contrast */
.text-secondary { color: #f1f2f4; } /* 1.12:1 ratio - FAILS */
.bg-blue-500 { background: #3b82f6; color: #262626; } /* 4.11:1 - FAILS */

/* AFTER: WCAG AA compliant */
.text-secondary { color: #6b7280; } /* 4.5:1+ ratio - PASSES */
.bg-blue-500 { background: #3b82f6; color: #ffffff; } /* 4.5:1+ ratio - PASSES */
```

### Priority 2: Form Labels & ARIA

### Priority 3: Heading Hierarchy

### Priority 4: Icon & Button Labels

**Fix**: Add accessible names to icon buttons:

```jsx
// BEFORE: No accessible name
<button><Icon /></button>

// AFTER: Accessible name provided
<button aria-label="Delete item"><Icon /></button>
```
