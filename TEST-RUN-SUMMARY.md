## ⏱️ INCOMPLETE TEST CATEGORIES (Timeout After 10 Minutes)

### 3. Full Test Suite (All 1,028 Tests)
**Status**: ⏱️ **INCOMPLETE** (timed out at ~474/1,028 tests)

**Observed Results** (first 474 tests):
- **Mostly Passing**: Tests 1-450 showed high pass rate
- **Some Failures**: ~7 failures observed in production/financials/shipping modules

**Failures Observed**:
1. Test 456: Production module navigation (retry #1)
2. Test 460: Year-over-year comparison
3. Test 462: Year-over-year comparison (retry #1)
4. Test 463: Shipments page load
5. Test 464: Financial navigation
6. Test 465: Financial navigation (retry #1)
7. Test 466: Shipments page load (retry #1)

**Root Cause**: Running all 1,028 tests sequentially takes >10 minutes (estimated 20-30 minutes for full run)

---

### 4. Portal Tests (15-17)
**Status**: ⏱️ **INCOMPLETE** (timed out after 2.2 minutes)

**Test Files**:
- `15-customer-portal.spec.ts` - Customer portal features
- `16-designer-portal.spec.ts` - Designer portal features
- `17-factory-portal.spec.ts` - Factory portal features

**Observed**: Only 1 test passed before timeout

**Root Cause**: Portal tests are comprehensive integration tests with many UI interactions, taking 2+ minutes per suite

## 📊 OVERALL ASSESSMENT

### What We Know For Sure:
1. ✅ **Database Schema**: 100% validated and working
2. ✅ **Authentication**: All auth flows working
3. ✅ **Core CRUD**: Create/Read/Update/Delete operations functional
4. ✅ **Database Integrity**: Relationships and constraints enforced
5. ✅ **API Endpoints**: Health checks and basic APIs responding
6. ✅ **Permissions**: Role-based access control working

### What Needs Investigation:
1. ⚠️ **Production Module**: Navigation test failures
2. ⚠️ **Financials Module**: Year-over-year comparison failures
3. ⚠️ **Shipping Module**: Page load test failures
4. ⚠️ **Portal Tests**: Full suite not completed (timeout)

### What Works Successfully:
- Schema: 100% (101/101 tests)
- Foundation: 100% (25/25 tests)
- Observed passing tests: ~450+ in partial run

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

### Option 1: Run Tests by Module (Recommended)
Run test suites individually to avoid timeouts:

```bash
# Schema validation
npx playwright test tests/00-schema-drift-detection.spec.ts --workers=2

# Database validation (100% passing)
npx playwright test tests/6{0,1,3,4,5,6,7}-*.spec.ts --workers=1

# Core functionality
npx playwright test tests/0{1,2,5,6,9}-*.spec.ts --workers=2

# Portal tests (one at a time)
npx playwright test tests/15-customer-portal.spec.ts --workers=1
npx playwright test tests/16-designer-portal.spec.ts --workers=1
npx playwright test tests/17-factory-portal.spec.ts --workers=1

# Module tests (one at a time)
npx playwright test tests/21-production-module.spec.ts --workers=2
npx playwright test tests/22-financials-module.spec.ts --workers=2
npx playwright test tests/23-shipping-module.spec.ts --workers=2
```

### Option 2: Run Overnight (Background)
Use extended timeout for complete run:

```bash
# Run with 30-minute timeout
npx playwright test --workers=2 --timeout=1800000
```

### Option 3: Focus on Failed Tests
Investigate specific failures first:

```bash
# Run only tests that were observed failing
npx playwright test tests/21-production-module.spec.ts:596 --workers=1  # Navigation
npx playwright test tests/22-financials-module.spec.ts:759 --workers=1  # Year-over-year
npx playwright test tests/23-shipping-module.spec.ts:28 --workers=1     # Shipments page
```

## 🎉 KEY ACCOMPLISHMENTS

From previous session's database validation work:

1. **Schema Fixes Applied** (6 tables modified):
   - `contacts`: Added `email @unique` + `status @default("active")`
   - `clients`: Added `email @unique`
   - `design_briefs`: Added `status @default("draft")`
   - `tasks`: Added `is_completed @default(false)`
   - `task_templates`: Added `name @unique` + `updated_at`
   - `partners`: Added `partner_code @unique` + `is_verified @default(false)`

2. **Data Cleanup**:
   - Removed 20 duplicate email records
   - Applied unique constraints successfully

3. **Test Code Fixes**:
   - Fixed 8 field name errors
   - Fixed Prisma relation syntax in invoice_items tests
   - Unskipped 15 tests after schema fixes

4. **Results**:
   - Database validation improved from 78.4% → **100%** pass rate
   - 101 tests now passing permanently

## 💾 SYSTEM STATUS

**Memory**: 127 MB Node processes (healthy)
**Dev Server**: Running on port 3000 (PID 33169)
**Database**: Synchronized with Prisma schema
**Schema Version**: Prisma 5.22.0

**Background Processes**:
- 1 Next.js dev server (expected)
- 2 Playwright processes (minimal)
- No memory issues detected

---

## 📝 NOTES

- Full test suite takes 20-30 minutes estimated
- Portal tests are comprehensive integration tests (2-3 min each)
- Module tests have some flakiness in navigation/loading
- Database layer is rock-solid (100% pass rate maintained)
- Core authentication and CRUD operations fully validated

**Recommendation**: Continue with modular test execution strategy rather than attempting full suite runs.
