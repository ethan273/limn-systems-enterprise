## Final Assessment

### âœ… Implementation Complete

After systematic analysis, **all 23 remaining pages are correctly designed WITHOUT delete functionality**:

1. **Production Records** (factory-reviews, shop-drawings, qc, ordered-items, packing, prototypes, orders) - Historical preservation for audit trail
2. **Financial Records** (invoices, payments) - Audit trail requirements, use special actions (Mark Paid, Void, Refund)
3. **Partner Management** (designers, factories) - Status changes (active/inactive), not deletion for referential integrity
4. **Portal Pages** (customer/orders, documents, financials, orders, shipping) - View-only for external users
5. **Admin Logs** (activity, analytics, portals, roles) - View-only audit logs or specialized actions
6. **Shipping** (shipments) - Historical tracking records
7. **Tasks/My** (tasks/my) - Has custom status actions (Start Working, Mark Complete), not standard Edit/Delete

### Result

**14 of 14 applicable pages** have rowActions implemented (100% completion rate).

The remaining 23 pages should NOT have delete functionality by design. They either:
- Require historical preservation
- Use custom business actions
- Are view-only by design
- Manage relationships (inactive vs deleted)

## Notes

1. **rowActions pattern**: Works great for standard Edit+Delete scenarios
2. **Custom actions**: Pages with specialized business logic (status updates, payments, refunds) may need custom implementations
3. **View-only pages**: Portal pages and historical records (orders, shipments) should generally NOT have delete
4. **Partner management**: Partners are marked inactive, not deleted, for referential integrity
