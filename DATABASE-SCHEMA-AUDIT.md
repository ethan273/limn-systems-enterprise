## 📊 KEY TABLES & RELATIONSHIPS

### 1. **orders** (Line 3568)
**Primary Fields:**
- `id` (uuid)
- `order_number` (unique, varchar)
- `customer_id` (uuid, FK to customers)
- `collection_id` (uuid, FK to collections)
- `status` (varchar)

**Key Relationships:**
- ← `manufacturer_projects` (many-to-one via manufacturer_project_id)
- **Indirect relationship to orders** via: `quality_inspections → manufacturer_projects → collections → orders`

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** `quality_inspections` uses `manufacturer_project_id`, NOT `order_id`

---

### 4. **shipments** (Line 5549)
**Primary Fields:**

- `status` (string, default: "pending")
- `carrier_id` (uuid, FK to shipping_carriers)
- `shipped_date`, `estimated_delivery`, `actual_delivery` (timestamptz)
- `tracking_events` (json[])

**Key Relationships:**
- Links to orders via `order_id`
- ← `shipping_carriers` (many-to-one via carrier_id)

---

### 5. **invoices** (Line 2641)
**Primary Fields:**
- `id` (uuid)
- `invoice_number` (unique, string)
- `customer_id` (uuid, FK to customers)
- `order_id` (uuid, FK to orders) ← **Links to orders**
- `project_id` (uuid, FK to projects)
- `status` (string, default: "pending")
- `total_amount`, `amount_paid`, `balance_due` (decimal)
- `due_date`, `invoice_date` (dates)

**Key Relationships:**
- ← `orders` (many-to-one via order_id)
- ← `customers` (many-to-one via customer_id)
- → `invoice_items[]` (one-to-many)
- → `payment_allocations[]` (one-to-many)

---

### 6. **notifications** (Line 3386)
**Primary Fields:**
- `id` (uuid)
- `user_id` (string)
- `customer_id` (uuid, FK to customers)
- `type`, `title`, `message` (strings)
- `entity_type`, `entity_id` (polymorphic reference)
- `read` (boolean)
- `priority` (string)
- `data`, `sent_via` (json)

**Key Relationships:**
- ← `customers` (many-to-one via customer_id)
- Polymorphic references via `entity_type` + `entity_id`

---

## 🔍 CODE AUDIT FINDINGS

### Files Checked:
- ✅ `/src/server/api/routers/portal.ts` - quality_inspections usage
- ✅ `/src/server/api/routers/production-orders.ts` - production_orders usage
- ✅ `/tests/21-production-module.spec.ts` - UI testing (no direct DB refs)
- ✅ `/tests/22-financials-module.spec.ts` - UI testing (no direct DB refs)

### Findings:
1. **quality_inspections** is correctly queried with `manufacturer_project_id` (not order_id)
2. **production_orders** table exists and is correctly referenced with `order_id` FK
3. **No incorrect table names found** in codebase
4. **No incorrect field names found** in codebase

## ⚠️ CRITICAL NOTES

### For Realtime Configuration:
When setting up Supabase realtime policies:

1. **orders**: Filter by `customer_id`
2. **production_orders**: Join to orders via `order_id`, then filter by `customer_id`
3. **quality_inspections**:
   - Join chain: `quality_inspections → manufacturer_projects → collections → orders`
   - Then filter by `customer_id` from orders
4. **shipments**: Direct filter by `order_id`, then check order's `customer_id`
5. **invoices**: Direct filter by `customer_id` or `order_id → customer_id`

### Database Access Pattern:
```sql
-- Correct join for quality_inspections to orders
quality_inspections
  INNER JOIN manufacturer_projects ON quality_inspections.manufacturer_project_id = manufacturer_projects.id
  INNER JOIN collections ON manufacturer_projects.collection_id = collections.id
  INNER JOIN orders ON collections.id = orders.collection_id
WHERE orders.customer_id = auth.uid()
```

## ✅ CONCLUSION

**Schema Status:** All table and field references are correct and in sync with Prisma schema.

**No action required** - codebase is using correct table/field names throughout.

**Recommendation:** Use this document as a reference when writing new database queries or setting up realtime subscriptions.
