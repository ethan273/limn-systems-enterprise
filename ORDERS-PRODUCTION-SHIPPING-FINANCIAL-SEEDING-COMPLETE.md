## 🎯 WHAT WAS SEEDED

Successfully extended the existing 25 customer journeys with complete Order → Production → Shipping → Invoice → Payment workflows:

### New Data Created:
- ✅ **25 Orders** - Customer orders with realistic order numbers (ORD-2025-001 through ORD-2025-025)
- ✅ **64 Order Items** - Product line items (2-3 items per order) from Production Ready catalog
- ✅ **25 Production Orders** - Manufacturing orders (PRD-2025-001 through PRD-2025-025)
- ✅ **25 Shop Drawings** - Technical drawings (SD-001 through SD-025)
- ✅ **25 QC Inspections** - Quality control checkpoints (final_inspection stage)
- ✅ **25 Shipments** - Shipping records with carriers and tracking numbers (SHP-2025-001 through SHP-2025-025)
- ✅ **25 Invoices** - Customer invoices with tax calculations (INV-2025-001 through INV-2025-025)
- ✅ **63 Invoice Items** - Invoice line items mirroring order items
- ✅ **20 Payments** - Payment records for paid/partial invoices (PAY-2025-001 through PAY-2025-020)

## 🛠️ IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### Approach Used:
**Direct SQL Seeding** via extended PostgreSQL shell script

**Why This Approach**:
- ✅ Fast execution (~3-4 minutes for complete pipeline)
- ✅ No Prisma schema complexity issues
- ✅ Direct database access with proper schema awareness
- ✅ Builds on existing 25 customer journeys
- ✅ Maintains all foreign key relationships

### Script Location:
```
/scripts/seed/seed-orders-production-shipping-financial.sh
```

### How to Run:
```bash
chmod +x scripts/seed/seed-orders-production-shipping-financial.sh
./scripts/seed/seed-orders-production-shipping-financial.sh
```

### Critical Schema Adaptations Made:
1. **order_items**: No `total` field (computed automatically)
2. **invoice_items**: No `total` field (uses computed `line_total`), requires `description` field
3. **shop_drawings**: Uses `current_version` not `version`, requires `drawing_name` and `created_by`
4. **qc_inspections**: Uses `order_id` and `order_item_id` (not `production_order_id`), requires `qc_stage` enum
5. **payments**: `invoice_id` is TEXT not UUID, `amount` is INTEGER in cents, `payment_date` is TEXT not TIMESTAMP

### Seed Data Characteristics:
- UUIDs generated via `uuidgen` command
- Random intervals for realistic date distribution
- Sequential numbering for easy identification (ORD-2025-XXX, PRD-2025-XXX, etc.)
- Proper financial calculations using `bc` for decimal precision
- Boolean flags for deposit_paid/final_payment_paid based on production status
