# Limn Systems Enterprise - Comprehensive Codebase Audit Report

**Audit Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Total Pages Found:** 186 page.tsx files  
**Scope:** Routing & Navigation, Placeholder Pages, Incomplete Features, Missing CRUD Operations, Broken Links, API Endpoints, Module Completeness

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Limn Systems Enterprise codebase has significant gaps in functionality and consistency:

- **Critical Missing Functionality:** 5+ authentication flows missing
- **Incomplete Features:** 8+ modules with "coming soon" placeholders  
- **Missing CRUD Pages:** 2 modules missing create/edit pages (Prospects, multiple Product types)
- **Portal Gaps:** Designer, Factory, QC profiles have incomplete implementations
- **Placeholder Code:** 14+ pages with "coming soon" or incomplete functionality messages

---

## 1. CRITICAL MISSING FUNCTIONALITY

### 1.1 Authentication Pages (Discovered Earlier)
- Missing forgot password flow
- Missing password reset page
- Missing multi-factor authentication pages
- Missing account recovery flows
- Missing email verification completion page

### 1.2 CRM Module Gaps
**Missing:** `/crm/prospects/new` and `/crm/prospects/[id]/edit` pages

**Current State:**
```
✓ /crm/prospects/page.tsx (list)
✓ /crm/prospects/[id]/page.tsx (detail view)
✗ /crm/prospects/new/page.tsx (CREATE - MISSING)
✗ /crm/prospects/[id]/edit/page.tsx (UPDATE - MISSING)
```

**Impact:** Users cannot create new prospects or edit existing ones through the UI. The API supports it (`api.crm.leads.convertToClient`) but UI is missing.

---

## 2. INCOMPLETE FEATURES - "COMING SOON" PAGES

### 2.1 Portal Profile Editing (CRITICAL)
**File:** `/portal/profile/page.tsx` (Line 105)

```typescript
if (profileData?.type !== 'customer') {
  alert('Profile editing is currently only available for customer portal users. 
         Designer, Factory, and QC profiles coming soon!');
  return;
}
```

**Missing Functionality:**
- Designer profile editing
- Factory profile editing  
- QC Tester profile editing

**Status:** View-only mode works; edit mode completely missing for 3 portal types

---

### 2.2 Portal Page Placeholders

**Designer Portal - Quality Reporting:** `/portal/designer/quality/page.tsx` (Line 69)
```typescript
<p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mt-2">Quality reporting coming soon</p>
```
Status: Page exists but is empty stub - shows "No quality items available"

**Designer Portal - Document Management:** `/portal/designer/documents/page.tsx` (Line 69)
```typescript
<p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mt-2">Document management coming soon</p>
```
Status: Page exists but is empty stub

**Factory Portal - Quality Reporting:** `/portal/factory/quality/page.tsx` (Line 69)
```typescript
<p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mt-2">Quality reporting coming soon</p>
```
Status: Page exists but is empty stub

**Factory Portal - Document Management:** `/portal/factory/documents/page.tsx` (Line 69)
```typescript
<p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mt-2">Document management coming soon</p>
```
Status: Page exists but is empty stub

---

### 2.3 Finance Module Gaps

**Financial Reports - Export Function:** `/financials/reports/page.tsx` (Line 106)
```typescript
onClick={() => alert('Export functionality coming soon')}
```
Status: Export button exists but shows alert - not functional

---

### 2.4 CRM Dashboard

**File:** `/crm/page.tsx` (Line 10)
```typescript
<p className="text-secondary">CRM dashboard coming soon...</p>
```
Status: Main CRM dashboard is placeholder - only shows text message

---

### 2.5 Admin Analytics Gaps

**File:** `/admin/analytics/page.tsx` (Lines 384-417)

Multiple business metrics are placeholders:
```typescript
<Card data-testid="revenue-chart">
  <CardHeader><CardTitle>Revenue Analytics</CardTitle></CardHeader>
  <CardContent><div className="empty-state-sm">Revenue analytics coming soon</div></CardContent>
</Card>

<Card data-testid="production-metrics">

</Card>

<Card data-testid="inventory">
  <CardHeader><CardTitle>Inventory Overview</CardTitle></CardHeader>
  <CardContent><div className="empty-state-sm">Inventory overview coming soon</div></CardContent>
</Card>
```

Status: Test IDs suggest these were planned but never implemented

## 10. RECOMMENDATIONS - PRIORITY ORDER

### Phase 1: CRITICAL FIXES (Must do immediately)
1. Implement missing authentication flows
2. Add CRM Prospect create/edit pages and API endpoints
3. Unblock portal profile editing for Designer/Factory/QC
4. Implement product create/edit functionality

### Phase 2: HIGH-PRIORITY COMPLETIONS (Next sprint)
1. Implement portal quality reporting (Designer/Factory)
2. Implement portal document management (Designer/Factory)
3. Add design brief/project edit pages
4. Implement finance export functionality

### Phase 3: MEDIUM-PRIORITY ENHANCEMENTS (Subsequent sprints)
1. Complete invoice/payment editing
2. Fill in dashboard placeholder cards
3. Implement remaining admin analytics
4. Complete QC/other profile editing

### Phase 4: POLISH & OPTIMIZATION
1. Remove all "coming soon" placeholder messages
2. Standardize error handling across incomplete features
3. Add user-facing notifications for blocked actions
4. Implement proper access controls

---

## 11. CODE QUALITY OBSERVATIONS

### Anti-patterns Found:
1. Alert-based feature blocking (should be proper UI controls)
2. Placeholder div blocks with hardcoded text
3. Inconsistent CRUD page patterns
4. Missing validation on create/edit flows

### Best Practices Observed:
1. tRPC for type-safe API calls
2. Consistent loading/error states
